├── docs/
├── assets/
├── tests/
├── tools/
├── config/
├── plugins/
├── data/
├── .github/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── CHANGELOG.md
```

## How to Use This Structure

- **Development**: Begin by adding your code to the appropriate subdirectory within `src/`. Use the `common/` directory for shared components or utilities.
- **Documentation**: Add or update documentation in the `docs/` directory. Make sure to keep user guides and developer guides up to date as the project evolves.
- **Testing**: Place your test cases in the `tests/` directory, organized by type.
- **Assets**: Store all design files, images, and branding materials in the `assets/` directory.
- **Configuration**: Use the `config/` directory to manage environment-specific settings, ensuring smooth deployment across dev, staging, and production environments.
- **Plugins**: If developing or integrating plugins, add them to the `plugins/` directory.

This structure is designed to be expandable as the project grows. As new needs arise, you can easily add additional subdirectories or files while maintaining a clear and organized repository.
