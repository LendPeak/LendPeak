### Loan Servicing Engine: Detailed Requirements Document

---

#### **1. Overview**

The Loan Servicing Engine is a core component designed to manage the amortization and servicing of loans, providing flexibility in handling various loan structures, payment schedules, and borrower scenarios. This engine will support both standard and complex loan configurations, ensuring robust and accurate calculations while allowing for custom restructures based on borrower needs or lender requirements.

#### **2. Functional Requirements**

**2.1. Amortization**

- **Fixed Rate Amortization:**
  - Support for standard fixed-rate loans with equal monthly payments.
  - Ability to handle variable interest rates across periods.
- **Adjustable-Rate Amortization:**

  - Ability to amortize loans with adjustable rates, reflecting changes in the rate periodically.
  - Cap and floor adjustments on rates to prevent drastic changes.

- **Interest-Only Amortization:**
  - Support for interest-only periods, where the principal balance remains unchanged.
- **Balloon Payment Amortization:**

  - Capability to include balloon payments at the end of the loan term.

- **Daily Simple Interest Calculation:**

  - Daily accrual of interest based on the outstanding principal.
  - Ability to account for payments made on non-standard days.

- **Monthly Pre-Calculated Interest:**
  - Support for pre-calculated monthly interest, typically used in fixed-rate mortgages.

**2.2. Loan Restructures**

- **Rate Modification:**
  - Modify the interest rate for specific periods during the loan term.
- **Payment Reduction:**

  - Support for short-term payment reductions, allowing borrowers to pay less than the scheduled amount for a defined period.

- **Rate Suspension:**

  - Ability to reduce the interest rate to zero for specific months, allowing borrowers to skip payments during hardship.

- **Term Extension:**

  - Extend the loan term, adjusting the amortization schedule accordingly.

- **Balloon Payment Adjustment:**

  - Restructure loans to include or adjust the amount of a balloon payment at the end of the term.

- **Payment Date Modification:**

  - Change the due date for loan payments, reflecting this change in the amortization schedule.

- **Prepayments:**

  - Handle prepayments, reducing the principal and recalculating the remaining schedule.
  - Manage prepayments with excess, allowing for the excess to be applied to future payments or principal reduction.

- **Partial Payments:**
  - Support for partial payments, allocating the amount towards interest, principal, or fees based on lender preference.

**2.3. Calendar Handling**

- **Support for Multiple Calendar Types:**
  - 30/360, Actual/360, Actual/365, and other relevant calendars.
  - Ability to perform date arithmetic based on different calendar methods.
- **Custom Calendar Implementation:**
  - Allow for custom calendar definitions that can be applied to specific loan contracts.

**2.4. Interest Calculations**

- **Deferred Interest Management:**

  - Support for deferred interest during loan modifications, ensuring accurate tracking and application.

- **Negative Amortization:**

  - Handle scenarios where the scheduled payment does not cover the interest due, adding the unpaid interest to the principal.

- **Interest Rate Cap/Collar:**
  - Implement caps and collars to limit the range within which the interest rate can fluctuate.

**2.5. Payment Processing**

- **AutoPay Integration:**
  - Support for automated payment processing, including ACH, card payments, and other methods.
- **Excess Payment Handling:**

  - Allocate excess payments to future payments, principal reduction, or other fees as defined by lender rules.

- **Fee Application:**

  - Apply fees such as late fees, processing fees, and other charges automatically based on loan conditions.

- **Payment Holiday:**

  - Offer payment holidays during predefined periods without penalizing the borrower.

- **Pre-Bill Day Cycles:**
  - Ability to handle pre-bill day cycles, allowing interest to be posted on the contract before the due date of the bill based on this configuration.
  - Determine when the bill becomes available to be paid, considering the pre-bill configuration.

**2.6. Reporting and Compliance**

- **Amortization Schedule Generation:**

  - Generate detailed amortization schedules, including principal and interest breakdowns.

- **Audit Trail:**

  - Maintain an audit trail for all calculations, restructures, and payment modifications.

- **Compliance Reporting:**
  - Ensure compliance with local regulations, including disclosures and borrower communication requirements.
