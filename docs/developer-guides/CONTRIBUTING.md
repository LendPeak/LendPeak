# Contributing to LendPeak

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or suggesting new ideas, your contributions are greatly appreciated.

## **How to Contribute**

### **1. Fork the Repository**

Before you start working on a new feature or bug fix, create a fork of the repository on GitHub. This will allow you to make changes in a separate copy of the project.

### **2. Create a New Branch**

Create a new branch for your work. This helps to keep your changes organized and makes it easier to submit a pull request later.

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

### **3. Make Your Changes**

Work on your new feature, bug fix, or documentation improvement. Ensure that your code follows the project's style guidelines and is well-documented.

### **4. Commit Your Changes**

Once your changes are ready, commit them to your branch. Write clear and descriptive commit messages.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature XYZ"
```

### **5. Push Your Changes**

Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin my-new-feature
```

### **6. Submit a Pull Request**

Go to the original repository on GitHub and submit a pull request from your forked branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes, including the problem you're solving or the feature you're adding.

### **7. Review Process**

Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be ready to make changes based on feedback. We aim to respond to pull requests as quickly as possible.

### **8. Code of Conduct**

Please ensure that your contributions adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We value respectful and constructive communication.

## **Contribution Guidelines**

- **Code Quality**: Ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and follows the coding standards used in the project.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features or bug fixes when applicable. All tests should pass before submitting a pull request.
- **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect any changes in the codebase. This includes updating the README, user guides, and any relevant files in the `docs/` directory.
- **Issue Reporting**: If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue before working on it. This helps to avoid duplicate efforts and ensures that the maintainers agree with the proposed changes.
